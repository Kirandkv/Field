# Roadmap and Backlog

Legend: **P0** required before any public release · **P1** portfolio differentiation · **P2** polish.
Complexity: S/M/L.

## P1 — Docs milestone 2 (planned, not started)

- OCR fallback (Tesseract) for scanned pages + OCR-degradation simulator
- Qdrant dense retrieval, hybrid fusion (RRF), cross-encoder reranking
- Chunking-strategy benchmark (fixed/recursive/sentence-aware/semantic/layout-aware/parent-child/table-aware/small-to-big) with comparative report
- Bilingual English/Arabic manual + cross-lingual retrieval eval subset
- Next.js web UI: document library, query workspace, citation viewer with bounding boxes, retrieval-debug drawer
- Live LLM adapter (OpenAI-compatible + Ollama) behind the existing `ModelAdapter` interface
- RBAC (Viewer/Operator/Engineer/Safety Manager/Administrator) enforced server-side
- OpenTelemetry tracing, MLflow experiment tracking

## P0 — FieldForge Copilot slice 1 (done)

| ID | Title | Files | Acceptance criteria | Complexity | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| COP-001 | Copilot contracts | `packages/contracts/copilot_models.py` | Device/TelemetryPoint/Alert/Incident/Evidence/ApprovalRequest/ApprovalDecision/MaintenanceTicket/ToolResult; 12-state `IncidentState` enum | S | — |
| COP-002 | Explicit state machine | `services/agent_copilot/state_machine.py` | Transition table; invalid transitions raise; unit-tested | S | COP-001 |
| COP-003 | Synthetic telemetry + Isolation Forest | `data/generators/generate_telemetry.py`, `services/anomaly/` | 3 devices, 4 alert scenarios, deterministic seed; real scikit-learn `IsolationForest` per device | M | — |
| COP-004 | Agent tools + orchestrator | `services/agent_copilot/tools.py`, `orchestrator.py` | 6 read-only tools + draft; `retrieve_sop` is a real HTTP call to the Docs API with graceful degradation; SOP-014 corroboration policy implemented | M | COP-001..003 |
| COP-005 | FastAPI app with approval gate | `apps/copilot_api/` | `/alerts`, `/incidents`, `/approvals`, `/approvals/{id}/decision` (role-checked server-side), `/tickets` | M | COP-004 |
| COP-006 | Tests + eval scenarios | `tests/`, `evals/datasets/copilot_scenarios_v1.jsonl` | State-machine invalid-transition tests; 12 scenarios (classification ×4, approve/reject/modify, RBAC ×2, idempotency, tool-failure, degraded-evidence); baseline committed | M | COP-005 |

All six shipped; see [evals/reports](../evals/reports) for the measured baseline
(`goal_completion_rate=1.0`, `unauthorized_action_prevention_rate=1.0` on the current 12-scenario set).

## P1 — Copilot milestone 2 (planned, not started)

- Remaining 11 of 17 program-brief tools: `check_camera_service`, `check_ocr_service`,
  `check_network_health`, `search_previous_incidents`, `retrieve_manual` (separate from
  `retrieve_sop`), `draft_operator_notification`, `send_operator_notification`,
  `request_service_restart`, `generate_incident_report`, `calculate_rate_of_change` and
  `detect_missing_data` as standalone tools (currently folded into `summarize_telemetry_window`)
- Scale evaluation scenarios from 12 to the program brief's ≥50
- `PARTIAL` and `CANCELLED` (human-approval-timeout) states — see ADR 0002
- Automatic retry/escalation policy for `REQUESTING_MORE_EVIDENCE` (currently terminal)
- Real-time telemetry chart, incident replay, agent-state visualization (needs a web UI first)
- English/Arabic incident summaries
- LangGraph adoption once Mesh needs multi-agent graph composition (ADR 0002 decision 1)

## P0 — FieldForge Mesh slice 1 (done)

| ID | Title | Files | Acceptance criteria | Complexity | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MESH-001 | A2A/MCP contracts | `packages/contracts/mesh_models.py` | AgentCard/A2ATask/A2ATaskStatus/AnalystFinding/DelegationRecord/MeshIncidentReport | S | — |
| MESH-002 | Shared telemetry service extraction | `services/telemetry/` | `TelemetryStore` moved out of Copilot's package so Mesh doesn't depend on Copilot internals; Copilot re-tested green after the move | S | — |
| MESH-003 | `telemetry-mcp` real MCP server | `services/mcp_telemetry/` | Official `mcp` SDK; 4 tools (query_telemetry, compare_devices, run_anomaly_detection, get_sensor_metadata); tool listing + tool call tested via the real SDK | M | MESH-001, MESH-002 |
| MESH-004 | Telemetry Analyst agent | `apps/mesh_telemetry_agent/` | Separately deployable; agent-card endpoint; A2A task create/get/cancel; shared-secret auth; shares tool implementations with MESH-003 | M | MESH-003 |
| MESH-005 | Incident Commander agent | `apps/mesh_commander/` | Separately deployable; real HTTP agent discovery; A2A delegation; in-process Safety Officer (always requires human approval); disagreement-preserving report | M | MESH-004 |
| MESH-006 | Tests + eval scenarios | `tests/`, `evals/datasets/mesh_scenarios_v1.jsonl` | 37 new tests incl. a real second-process integration test (uvicorn in a background thread, not mocked HTTP); 11 scenarios (delegation ×4, degradation ×4, discovery ×3); baseline committed | M | MESH-005 |

All six shipped; see [evals/reports](../evals/reports) for the measured baseline
(`goal_completion_rate=1.0`, `delegation_accuracy=1.0`, `graceful_degradation_rate=1.0`,
`agent_discovery_success_rate=1.0` on the current 11-scenario set).

## P1 — Mesh milestone 2 (planned, not started)

- Remaining agent roles: Document Intelligence, Vision Inspection, Maintenance Planner, Safety
  Officer as its own service, Report Agent
- Remaining MCP servers: `documents-mcp`, `robot-health-mcp`, `maintenance-mcp`, `deployment-mcp`
- True cross-*agent* disagreement (today's disagreement is between two signals from one analyst —
  ADR 0003 decision 5) once a second opinionated agent (e.g. Vision Inspection) exists
- Async task execution + real polling (tasks complete synchronously today — ADR 0003 decision 6)
- Scale evaluation scenarios from 11 to the program brief's ~40
- Live delegation graph UI, agent-capability registry UI, permissions explorer
- Scoped per-capability agent tokens (today's shared secret is all-or-nothing)
- Reconcile the hand-rolled A2A shape against the official `a2a-sdk`/spec — ADR 0003 decision 2

## P1 — Ops vertical slice (planned, not started)

- Trace explorer over Docs' correlation IDs (first real trace source)
- One quality gate demo (regression → PR gate fails → fix → gate passes) per program brief §Profile D

## P2 — Polish (planned)

- FieldForge Edge offline profile
- Demo GIF, video scripts, portfolio page copy (only after P0/P1 numbers are real)

## Non-negotiables carried on every item

No fabricated metrics. No disabled tests to pass CI. No secrets committed. Every P0 item ships
with its own tests before being marked done.
